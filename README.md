Introduction:
Advanced Tic Tac Toe is an enhanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, designed to provide a more challenging and engaging experience for players. In this game, players can enjoy single-player mode against an AI opponent, with adjustable difficulty levels to suit their preferences.

Objective:
The objective of Advanced Tic Tac Toe is to achieve a winning configuration of symbols (X or O) on the game board, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does. Players take turns placing their symbols on the board, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent and secure victory.

Features:
•	Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game features an intuitive and visually appealing GUI built using the Tkinter library in Python, allowing players to interact with the game board seamlessly.
•	Single-Player Mode: Players can enjoy a challenging single-player experience against an AI opponent, with adjustable difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to accommodate players of all skill levels.
•	Game Logic: The game implements robust logic for gameplay, including handling player moves, AI decision-making using the Minimax algorithm, and detecting game over conditions (win, lose, tie).
•	Play Again Option: After the game concludes, players have the option to play again with the click of a button, resetting the game board for a new round of gameplay.

Implementation Details:
1.	Game Board:
•	The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, implemented using a nested list data structure in Python.
•	Each cell on the grid can hold one of three values: 'X', 'O', or ' ' (empty).
•	The game board is updated dynamically as players make moves during gameplay.



2.	Player Actions:
•	Players take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the game board by clicking on the corresponding cell in the GUI.
•	The make_move(row, col) function handles player moves by updating the game board and checking for a winning condition or tie.

3.	AI Decision-Making:
•	The AI opponent's decision-making is powered by the Minimax algorithm, a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory.
•	In the 'easy' difficulty level, the AI makes random moves by selecting an empty cell on the game board.
•	In the 'medium' difficulty level, the AI evaluates potential winning or blocking moves and selects the best available option.
•	In the 'hard' difficulty level, the AI employs the Minimax algorithm to recursively evaluate potential future game states and select the optimal move.

4.	Graphical User Interface (GUI):
•	The GUI is created using the Tkinter library in Python, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface for players.
•	The game board is displayed as a grid of buttons, with each button representing a cell on the game board.
•	Players interact with the GUI by clicking on the buttons to make moves and adjust the difficulty level via the menu bar.

5.	Game Over Conditions:
•	The check_winner() function is responsible for detecting game over conditions, including a winning configuration of symbols ('X' or 'O') or a tie.
•	When a game over condition is met, the game_over() function displays a message box with the outcome of the game (win, lose, or tie) and provides an option to play again.

6.	Resetting the Game:
•	The reset_game() function resets the game board and game state for a new round of gameplay, allowing players to start fresh after completing a game.User Interface Design:
•	The game's user interface features a clean and intuitive layout, with a 3x3 grid representing the game board and buttons for player interaction. The difficulty level is displayed prominently at the top of the interface, allowing players to easily adjust the game's challenge level.

Testing:
Thorough testing was conducted throughout the development process to ensure the game functions correctly under various scenarios. Test cases were devised to cover all aspects of gameplay, including player moves, AI behavior, and game over conditions.

Future Enhancements:
Potential future enhancements for the game include:
•	Adding additional difficulty levels or customizable AI behavior.
•	Implementing multiplayer functionality to allow players to compete against each other online.
•	Enhancing the game's visual aesthetics with custom graphics and animations.


Libraries Used:
•	tkinter: for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
•	random: for generating random moves in the easy difficulty level.
•	Complexity: The game's overall complexity is moderate, with the primary challenge lying in the implementation of the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making. The game's graphical user interface adds an additional layer of complexity in handling user interactions and displaying game elements effectively.

Functions Used:
•	create_board(): Creates the game board grid and initializes the buttons for player interaction.
•	create_menu(): Creates the menu bar with options to set the difficulty level.
•	set_difficulty(difficulty): Sets the difficulty level chosen by the player.
•	make_move(row, col): Processes the player's move and updates the game state accordingly.
•	switch_player(): Alternates between X and O players.
•	computer_move(): Determines the AI opponent's move based on the chosen difficulty level.
•	check_winner(): Checks for a winning condition or a tie on the game board.
•	game_over(): Displays the game over message and provides an option to play again.
•	reset_game(): Resets the game board and game state for a new round of gameplay.
